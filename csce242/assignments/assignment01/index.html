        <h1>How to properly cook steak.</h1>
        <p> There has been a timeless debate on how to properly cook steak. This topic has divided house holds, communities, and even nations. I am here to solve resolve nation disputes once and for all. Please feel free to take notes.  </p>
        <p> Many people think that there are rare, medium rare, done, and well done. Im just going to go ahead and tell you that is wrong, there is rare, and overcooked. Some may say "What about blue rare?". Well we arent savages. I like the be able to swollow my steak. To achieve a perfectly cooked steak you need salt. Salt it and let it sit. Sear for 5 minutes each side and let it rest. You're welcome.</p>
