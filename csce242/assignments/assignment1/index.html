            My 9 year old daughter
        </h1>
        <p>My Daughter's name is Annabella Shealy. She was born on Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, 2 days before I had to put in my paperwork to reenlist in the Marine Corps. 
            She was the cutest baby I have every seen, and was instantly a daddys girl. Without any plans, I decided to leave the Marines, so i wouldnt have to leave her.  
        </p>

            Annabellas Hobbies
        </h2>
        <p>Annabella is just like i was when i was a kid. <b>WILD</b>. She has no siblings so i have to play hard with her. She is very Smart, creative, and talented.
            Shes humble about it too. I was told that she scored exceptionally high on her MAP testing, and makes straight A's. She loves the fact that I am going to
            Carolina, and loves to study with me. She <b>HATES</b> clemson, which makes me a proud papa.
