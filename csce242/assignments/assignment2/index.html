         <h2> Bootcamp </h2>
         <div id="Content">
         <p>    The Marine Corps changes from time to time. I arrived in Parris Island in Haloween 2010. Normally you get a period that allows you to learn what to expect, 
            and Poolies (potential recruits) all  run around Downtown Columbia to get into shape. My process took 2 weeks. One week of that I had to live in my car because 
            one guy backed out, and they told me I was leaving. So, I quit my job and moved my things out of my apartment. With my luck, the guy changed his mind, and got his spot back.
            I finally left from Ft Jacksons, MEPS station, and arrived. Your first encounter is an angry Drill instructor gets on the bus and does a whole lot of yelling.
            they guide you to the famous yellow footprints. Where you spend the next 2 days getting and carrying around all of your gear that you will need for the next 3 months.
            2 Sea Backs full, and your ruck sack. You have to carry it all to your barracks, which can be as far away as 500 yrds away. Then you get to sit and wait. Boot camp is broken Down
            into 3 phases.

         <h3> Occupational Training / Fleet</h3>
         <p>Once you finish Bootcamp, you go to your Occupational school. Your occupational schools vary from job to job. It can last a month, to a year. Infantry is fairly short, but you spend majority of the time in the fleet training.
            Most units will have PT in the morning, then go into a predetermined daily plan. You get told when to sleep, where to sleep, when to talk, and when to run. Training is none stop. With my experience in the Fleet, we went straight
            predeployment training which lasted a month, went back to Camp Lejeune, and deployed to Afhanistan a week later. It was a rotation of 6 months and a month off throughout. You will either deploy on a MEU, which is on a navy ship, 
            and visit places all over world. But that is if you are lucky. I went American Airlines with bag and rifle in my lap. 12 hour flight, to Germany and another few hours to Camp Manas in Kyrgyzstan. It was -10 degrees because it was 
            in the Himalayas. When separating, you go through mandatory Transitional training, where you learn minimal amount about how to use your GI Bill and get a job, while dealing with Stress that most people don't understand.
